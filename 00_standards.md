# Impacts of Computing - SOCIETY

###### K-1.IC.1 Identify and discuss how tasks are accomplished with and without computing technology.

Common tasks include sending a letter by email vs. post, taking a picture with a smart phone vs. camera, buying something with an app vs. with cash at a store.

###### K-1.IC.2 Identify and explain classroom and home rules related to computing technologies.

Rules could include when itâ€™s okay to use a device, what programs or apps are okay to use, how to treat the equipment, etc.

#### Activity:
For this activity, the teacher will prepare pairs of pictures of common tasks accomplished with and without computing technology. Examples include letters in the mail vs. email/ taking pictures with smartphones vs cameras/ buying something online vs at the store/ reading a paperback vs reading a tablet. If the teacher is completing this activity with the whole class, they can display a picture pair and discuss the following:
- What task is done in this picture pair?
- How is the task completed without computing technology? How is it completed with computing technology?
- Discuss when it would make more sense to complete the task without computing technology. Then discuss when the task should be completed using computing technology.

#### How the activity relates to both standards:
This task addresses both standards listed above. The first standard asks students to identify and discuss tasks that are completed with and without computing technology. In discussing using a smartphone to take a picture instead of a camera, students think of why one would be more useful than the other. They also naturally discuss rules applicable to using the computing technology. When is it acceptable to use it, when, and how?
