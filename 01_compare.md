Mission/Purpose |  Code.org/about: Code.orgÂ® is an education innovation nonprofit dedicated to the vision that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science as part of their core K-12 education. We expand access to computer science in schools, with a focus on increasing participation by young women and students from other underrepresented groups.  | csinsf.org/about.html: We aim to accomplish this by incorporating CS into the core curriculum for all students in the lower grades (Pre-K to 8). By beginning in the earliest grades and with all children, we will normalize a discipline that has been long dominated by a selective group of the population.
